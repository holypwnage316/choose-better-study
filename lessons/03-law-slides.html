            <section>
                <h2>Recap from Last Lesson</h2>
                <p>David Gordon's <em>Choose Better</em> presents <strong>5 models</strong> for biblical ethical decision-making:</p>
                <br>
                <ol>
                    <li>Imitation</li>
                    <li>Law</li>
                    <li>Wisdom</li>
                    <li>Communion</li>
                    <li>Warfare</li>
                </ol>
                <br>
                <p style="font-style: italic; color: #7f8c8d;">Last week we covered the imitation model. Today we take a deep dive into the law model.</p>
            </section>

            <!-- Slide 4: Overview -->
            <section>
                <h2>Overview</h2>
                <p>The Law Model focuses on obeying God's commands as revealed in Scripture, particularly the moral law summarized in the Ten Commandments.</p>
                <br>
                <p class="highlight" style="font-size: 1.1em;">
                    Has God, in Holy Scripture, commanded or prohibited this behavior?
                </p>
            </section>

            <!-- Slide 5: God's Authority -->
            <section>
                <h2>God's Authority to Rule</h2>
                <p>God has the rightful authority to direct that which he has made. This model acknowledges:</p>
                <br>
                <div class="model-card">
                    <p><strong>1)</strong> He has the <span class="highlight">right to govern us</span></p>
                </div>
                <div class="model-card">
                    <p><strong>2)</strong> He has the <span class="highlight">perfect wisdom and love</span> by which to govern us</p>
                </div>
            </section>

            <!-- Slide 6: Scripture - Authority -->
            <section>
                <h2>Scripture on God's Authority</h2>
                <div class="scripture-box">
                    <span class="scripture-ref">Psalm 100:3</span>
                    <p>Know that the Lord, he is God! It is he who made us, and we are his; we are his people, and the sheep of his pasture.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="scripture-box">
                    <span class="scripture-ref">1 Corinthians 6:20</span>
                    <p>You were bought with a price. So glorify God in your body.</p>
                </div>
                <p style="margin-top: 15px; font-size: 0.85em;">We were <em>created</em> by God, <em>sustained</em> by him, and <em>redeemed</em> by him &mdash; thrice obligated to serve him.</p>
            </section>

            <!-- Slide 7: Discussion Question #1 -->
            <section class="center-slide">
                <div class="discussion-question">
                    <h2>Discussion Question</h2>
                    <p>How does the secular world "borrow capital" from the biblical understanding of the law model?</p>
                </div>
            </section>

            <!-- Slide 8: Biblical Basis - Genesis -->
            <section>
                <h2>Biblical Basis: Genesis</h2>
                <p>God not only creates, but in the very act, issues a decree for how each aspect of what he has created is to serve him.</p>
                <br>
                <p>God effectively commanded each aspect of the created order to serve him by fulfilling a particular task &mdash; including the human task to <span class="highlight">"have dominion"</span> over the earth.</p>
                <br>
                <p style="font-style: italic; font-size: 0.85em;">All human suffering results from Adam's disobedience of God's prohibition against eating the fruit of one particular tree.</p>
            </section>

            <!-- Slide 9: Biblical Basis - Sinai & Great Commission -->
            <section>
                <h2>Biblical Basis: Sinai to the Great Commission</h2>
                <div class="model-card">
                    <h3>Mount Sinai</h3>
                    <p>The covenant at Sinai through Moses is characterized by laws; Moses brings down "ten words" from the mountain &mdash; at least nine of them are commands.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="model-card">
                    <h3>The Great Commission</h3>
                    <p>After his resurrection, Christ instructs his apostles to teach others "to observe all that I have commanded you."</p>
                </div>
                <br>
                <p style="font-style: italic; font-size: 0.85em;">From Genesis to the Great Commission, God's commands are woven throughout the whole story of Scripture.</p>
            </section>

            <!-- Slide 10: The Law Model and Human Nature -->
            <section>
                <h2>The Law Model &amp; Human Nature</h2>
                <p>The law model has played a dominant role in the church's discussion of ethics, especially since the <strong>Protestant Reformation</strong>.</p>
                <br>
                <ul style="font-size: 0.9em;">
                    <li>Luther's Small Catechism</li>
                    <li>The Heidelberg Catechism</li>
                    <li>The Westminster Shorter &amp; Larger Catechisms</li>
                </ul>
                <br>
                <p style="font-size: 0.85em;">All contain an exposition of the decalogue (Ten Commandments).</p>
            </section>

            <!-- Slide 11: Benefits of the Law Model -->
            <section>
                <h2>Benefits of the Law Model</h2>
                <div class="model-card">
                    <h3>Promotes Humility</h3>
                    <p>We recognize that we exist under the authority of our Maker.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="model-card">
                    <h3>Provides Specific Direction</h3>
                    <p>You shall not murder. You shall not commit adultery. You shall not steal. You shall not covet.</p>
                </div>
                <br>
                <p style="font-style: italic; font-size: 0.85em;">The human race is not left alone to discover every ethical answer by trial and error.</p>
            </section>

            <!-- Slide 12: Law and Our Fallen Nature -->
            <section>
                <h2>Law &amp; Our Fallen Nature</h2>
                <p>The law model is necessary because our affections and desires have been <strong>tainted by sin</strong>.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Like a child who reaches up to touch a hot stove, we often exhibit an unhealthy curiosity to explore dangerous areas.</p>
                <br>
                <div class="scripture-box">
                    <span class="scripture-ref">Romans 5:13</span>
                    <p>Sin indeed was in the world before the law was given.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="scripture-box">
                    <span class="scripture-ref">Galatians 3:19</span>
                    <p>Why then the law? It was added because of transgressions.</p>
                </div>
            </section>

            <!-- Slide 13: Scripture Reading -->
            <section>
                <h2>Scripture Reading</h2>
                <p>Let's have someone read <strong>1 Timothy 1:8-10</strong></p>
                <br>
                <p>Some commentators think Paul is being hyperbolic here, but David Gordon argues we have every reason to take his statement at face value.</p>
                <br>
                <p style="font-style: italic; font-size: 0.85em;">Biblical commands are a kind gift from God for us whose moral nature is fallen, just as a parent's warning to their child about not touching a hot stove.</p>
            </section>

            <!-- Slide 14: Discussion Question #2 -->
            <section class="center-slide">
                <div class="discussion-question">
                    <h2>Discussion Question</h2>
                    <p>Rightly understood, the law model should foster humility rather than pride and legalism. Why?</p>
                </div>
            </section>

            <!-- Slide 15: How the Law Model Functions -->
            <section>
                <h2>How the Law Model Functions</h2>
                <p>As we consider any behavioral choice, the model asks:</p>
                <p class="highlight" style="font-size: 1.05em; margin: 20px 0;">Does God command or prohibit this behavior?</p>
                <ul style="font-size: 0.9em;">
                    <li>Is it okay to desire another person's possessions? &rarr; God prohibits <strong>covetousness</strong></li>
                    <li>Desiring to injure someone in rage? &rarr; God prohibits <strong>murder and malicious thoughts</strong></li>
                    <li>What is our duty to our parents? &rarr; God commands us to <strong>honor them</strong></li>
                </ul>
                <br>
                <p style="font-size: 0.85em; font-style: italic;">This directness and clarity is what makes the law model such an efficient model for ethics.</p>

                    <h2>Discussion Question</h2>

            </section>

            <!-- Slide 17: Special Challenges Overview -->
            <section>
                <h2>Special Challenges</h2>
                <p>Some commands in Scripture do not oblige everyone. We must learn to distinguish:</p>
                <br>
                <ol class="challenge-list">
                    <li>Local vs. Universal Laws</li>
                    <li>Temporary vs. Eternal Laws</li>
                    <li>Covenant Stipulations vs. Moral Principles</li>
                </ol>
            </section>

            <!-- Slide 18: Local vs. Universal Laws -->
            <section>
                <h2>Local vs. Universal Laws</h2>
                <p>Some commands are addressed to specific individuals or groups.</p>
                <br>
                <div class="scripture-box">
                    <span class="scripture-ref">2 Timothy 4:13</span>
                    <p>"When you come, bring the cloak that I left with Carpus at Troas, also the books, and above all the parchments."</p>
                </div>
                <p style="margin-top: 15px;">Evidently, this command only applies to <strong>Timothy</strong>.</p>
            </section>

            <!-- Slide 19: Local vs. Universal - Continued -->
            <section>
                <h2>Local vs. Universal Laws</h2>
                <p>However, a few verses earlier:</p>
                <div class="scripture-box">

            <section>
                <h2>Temporary vs. Eternal Laws</h2>
                <p>Some laws are temporary obligations rather than obligations for all people for all time.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Many Mosaic laws obliged old covenant Israelites but do not oblige new covenant believers:</p>
                <ul style="font-size: 0.9em;">
                    <li>Circumcision</li>
                    <li>Ceremonial laws</li>
                    <li>Civil laws</li>
                </ul>
                <br>
                <p style="font-size: 0.85em; font-style: italic;">The Jerusalem Council in Acts 15 reveals the apostles themselves did not have an immediate answer to this problem.</p>

            <!-- Slide 21: The "Forever" Problem -->
            <section>
                <h2>The "Forever" Problem</h2>
                <p>Some commands are described as <span class="highlight">"eternal"</span> or <span class="highlight">"forever"</span> even though they no longer apply.</p>
                <br>
                <div class="scripture-box">
                    <span class="scripture-ref">Leviticus 23:14</span>
                    <p>"A statute forever throughout your generations"</p>
                </div>
                <br>
                <p>The Feast of Firstfruits was called "forever" &mdash; yet the Jewish calendar expired with the resurrection of Christ.</p>
                <br>
                <p style="font-size: 0.85em;">We must distinguish commands that delineate the relation between creatures and their Creator from those that merely lasted for the duration of a given covenant administration.</p>

                <p>All biblical laws are in fact <strong>covenant stipulations</strong>, placed by God on the parties with whom he covenants.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Just as you are not obligated to make mortgage payments to <em>my</em> banker, nor I to <em>yours</em> &mdash; the commands in the Bible are addressed to, and oblige only, a <span class="highlight">specific covenant people</span>.</p>

                <p style="margin-bottom: 15px;">How do we determine if a command obliges us also?</p>
                <ol class="numbered-list">
                    <li>Is the law reiterated in another covenant administration?</li>

                    <li>Is the law supplied prior to the fall?</li>
                    <li>Does the command describe the final, redeemed state?</li>
                    <li>Is the law supplied with an extra-covenantal rationale?</li>
                    <li>Does the command reflect a moral attribute of God?</li>
                    <li>Does the command reflect the distinctive features of a given covenant administration?</li>

            <section>
                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p>Every biblical law is governed by two things:</p>
                <br>
                <div class="model-card">
                    <h3>God's Unchanging Moral Character</h3>
                    <p>The Creator's innate, morally praiseworthy, and unchanging moral character</p>
                </div>
                <div class="model-card">
                    <h3>God's Purposes for Particular Creatures</h3>
                    <p>His varying purposes for various creatures and covenant communities</p>
                </div>
                <br>
                <p style="font-size: 0.85em; font-style: italic;">The law <em>requiring</em> circumcision, and the apostolic mandate <em>refusing</em> its requirement, are both consistent with God's moral character &mdash; but reflect different purposes for different covenant communities.</p>
