## Overview

This lesson introduces the book *Choose Better* and its central premise: that Scripture provides not one but five distinct models for making ethical decisions. Each model has its place, and mature believers learn when and how to apply each one.

## Discussion Questions

1. How do you typically make ethical decisions?
2. Have you ever felt like the "What would Jesus do?" approach didn't quite fit a situation?
3. Why might God give us multiple models for ethical decision-making rather than just one?

## Key Takeaways

- Ethics is not one-size-fits-all
- Scripture models multiple approaches to moral reasoning
- Wisdom involves knowing which model to apply in which situation
