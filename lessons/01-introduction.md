## Overview *(Slide 3)*

- This lesson introduces the book *Choose Better* and its central premise: that Scripture provides not one but five distinct models for making ethical decisions.
- Each model has its place, and mature believers learn when and how to apply each one.

### Introduction *(Slides 4–5)*

- *Choose Better: Five Biblical Models for Making Ethical Decisions* presents a comprehensive approach to Christian ethics by examining five distinct biblical models for moral decision-making. Rather than advocating for a single method, Gordon argues that Scripture itself employs multiple ethical frameworks, and mature believers should learn to use all five appropriately depending on the situation.
- In many ways, today will be kind of a general high level review of the material Peter has been leading us through.
- As we've discussed over the past few months, ethics is the study of how to live and how to live well.
- Within a theistic viewpoint, ethics can be seen as trying to live out our lives as God has intended us to live or would intend us to live. Of course, our own sin gets in the way of this.
- We've learned how our sin complicates and muddies the waters, so to speak, when we are trying to make biblical, ethical decisions about things.
- Really, every decision we make either contributes to or detracts from our human life as God created it.

*(Slide 5)*
- Returning to our ability to make choices: we should recognize that the capacity for rational thought is itself a distinctive mark of human nature. Other creatures created by God mostly run off instinct.
- We on the other hand, have the power to reason, and think, and assess before making a decision.
- We have the ability to think about the short term effects of a decision. We have the ability to think about the long term effects.
- We have the ability to reason and rationalize the pros and cons of a decision against both the short term and long term outcomes.
- For example, eating half a pan of freshly cooked, warm brownies has great short term rewards.
  - It tastes good.
  - It smells good.
  - It's fresh.
- However, the longer term benefits are not great.
  - You consume too many calories, which may lead to weight gain, or maybe you have to double your workout that day to make up for eating so much.

**Question: How do you typically make ethical decisions? What factors into your ethical decision making process? What doesn't?** *(Slide 6)*

*(Slide 7)*
- What we've just discussed—that process of weighing, considering, evaluating—that's distinctly human. Animals don't do this. They run on instinct.
- Socrates put it this way: "The unexamined life is not worth living for a human." So ethical reasoning isn't just something we *can* do—it's part of what makes us human.
- God designed us in such a way that we have the faculty to be able to reason and apply logic to try and determine the best outcomes for situations we may find ourselves in.
- Throughout our life, we have to make decisions with long-lasting impacts—on ourselves and those around us. Consider some examples:

    - Should aging parents come live with us, or should we find them a care facility?
    - Should we let our child commit to gymnastics every weekday evening?
    - How do we respond when a child is persistently disobedient?

- David Gordon says "it's right to raise such ethical questions, even before you answer them. Ethics is therefore not merely about answering choice-questions correctly; it's also about asking them in the first place and learning to ask the kinds of questions that might yield good answers" (Choose Better: Five Biblical Models for Making Ethical Decisions).

### The Choice Between Good and Better *(Slide 8)*

- I believe Peter has said this same concept over the course of our time studying ethics, but David Gordon states most of the time we are not choosing between good and evil choices. We are most often choosing between an okay or good choice vs a better choice.
- Personally, right as I was writing out my lesson plan for this part, Saleena, my wife, asked me if I wanted to take Sophia, my daughter, to her dance class or stay home and receive a dinner meal Debbie & John Christie were dropping off.
- Neither option inherently good or bad. However, I opted for taking Sophia to dance class.
- Not because I didn't want to see John or Debbie, but I knew going to dance would give me quiet time to work on my thoughts for class this morning. I also know Debbie was concerned about Saleena's health and not seeing her at church this past Sunday, so I figured she'd want to see Saleena more than me in this instance.

- We see this same dynamic in Scripture. In his book, David Gordon gives the example of Luke 10:38-42. __ASK SOMEONE TO READ THIS PART__. *(Slide 9)*

*(Slide 10)*
- So what did we learn here? Serving others is bad? No! Serving others is not wrong, in fact, it's a good thing to do. However, at this particular time, Mary had made the better choice. By listening to Jesus's instruction, she had chosen the good portion as we see in verse 42.
- One choice was good. Another choice was better.
- Therefore, our ethical decision making is not merely to distinguish good from bad, but more often, it's to distinguish good from better. The person who makes better choices through life typically has a better life than another person who mostly makes less-good choices.

**Question - Have you ever felt like the "WWJD?" approach didn't quite fit a situation you needed to make a decision for?** *(Slide 11)*

### Background to David Gordon's Five Models *(Slides 12–13)*

- Ok, let's start getting into David Gordon's Five Models for Making Ethical Decisions.
- David acknowledges that "...different aspects of the Christian tradition have made particular contributions to the entire church's ethical reasoning. Differing traditions "model" the ethical enterprise differently, and the combination of these [five] models yield more fruit than any one" by itself would.
- The five models he sees in scripture are:

    1. imitation
    2. law
    3. wisdom
    4. communion
    5. warfare

- David says each of the models can be thought as question clusters, and each model asks a different set of questions and each of those set of questions bring their own insight to an ethical perspective/decision making process.
- He goes on to give an example in the book comparing the law and wisdom models.
    - The law model is primarily concerned with whether an action is prescribed or proscribed by God in the Bible—what behaviors are required or forbidden. For example, the laws in Leviticus are commanding.
    - The law model also recognizes there are moments in life where we may not have time to contemplate, and we must act immediately.
    - The wisdom model, on the other hand, asks what kinds of effects and consequences our decisions will have. Many proverbs commend an action but don't command it.
    - This model is more contemplative—it asks us to think about possible outcomes and how they might ripple out to others.
- Each of the five models can be thought of as its own tool. Here's an analogy:
    - I'm in the process of finishing my basement at my house.
    - As I've been working on framing, putting up insulation, and installing electrical, I've needed different tools.
    - My air nailer works great when I'm framing walls on the ground; however, it doesn't help me one bit when I need to drill a hole through the wall studs to run electrical wiring.
    - I need a different tool for that.
- Just like these different tools work together toward finishing my basement, the five models work together toward the same goal: helping us make the best biblical ethical choices we can.
- Each model is necessary, yet insufficient on its own, to inform every ethical quandary that comes our way.
- Knowing how each model works will equip us to make better ethical choices in life.

### Introduction to the Five Models *(Slides 14–16)*

- Let's briefly introduce each of the five models. We'll go deeper into each one in future lessons.

#### The Imitation Model *(Slide 14)*
- "The imitation model understands human life to consist, ideally, in our being like God on a creaturely scale".
- Humans were created in the image of God and thus must reflect many praiseworthy attributes of God.
- This model emphasizes what one __is__ vs what one __does__.
- Functionally, this model requires us to learn about God and what is great and praiseworthy about him, especially as revealed through Jesus.

- "The imitation model asks and answers the following question: does this decision allow me (or us) to emulate God or to cultivate human traits that reflect his image?".

#### The Law Model *(Slide 14)*
- "The law model understands human life to consist, ideally, in our obeying God, who has rightful authority to order his creation as he wishes. God sustains the relation of the Lawgiver and Judge to his creation, and the creature must acknowledge this relation by obeying God's commands and wishes."

- The law model asks and answers the following question: has God, in Holy Scripture, commanded or prohibited this behavior?

#### The Wisdom Model *(Slide 15)*
- "The wisdom model understands life to consist, ideally, in making wise choices moment by moment, day by day. The human is understood to have the ability to observe and learn from observing, that there are choices that contribute to or detract from order, health, and faith."

- The wisdom model answers the following question: what is the likely outcome of my/our doing or not doing this?

#### The Communion Model *(Slide 15)*
- The communion model understands human life to consist in communication with God.
- The human is understood to have the unique ability, among creatures, of linguistic communication.
- We are able to address and be addressed by God.
- With this model, prayer is not something we do occasionally, in moments or seasons of special need.
- Life itself is prayer. A fellowship with God.

- The communion model answers the following question: how might this option enhance or hinder my communion with God?

#### The warfare model *(Slide 16)*
- The final model is the warfare model.
- This model understands life as a war, in which we are enlisted soldiers for one side.
- Our duties are then thought of as both defensive and offensive, both resisting and attacking the enemy ourselves and gaining new ground.

- The warfare model helps answer the following question: In the often invisible, yet real warfare between the forces of good and evil, will this decision likely serve the forces of good or the forces of evil.


**Question - Based on the initial descriptions, which model do you tend to draw on most often when evaluating ethical questions or dilemmas?** *(Slide 17)*

**Question (if time allows) - Complete the following sentences: My family of origin emphasized the __________ model when I was growing up. My family of origin neglected the _______ model. Give examples** *(Slide 18)*

## Key Takeaways *(Slide 19)*

- Ethics is not one-size-fits-all
- Scripture models multiple approaches to moral reasoning
- Wisdom involves knowing which model to apply in which situation
