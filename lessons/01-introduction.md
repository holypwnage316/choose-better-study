## Overview

This lesson introduces the book *Choose Better* and its central premise: that Scripture provides not one but five distinct models for making ethical decisions. Each model has its place, and mature believers learn when and how to apply each one.

### Introduction

In many ways, today will be kind of a general high level review of the material Peter has been leading us through. As we've discussed over the past few months, ethics is the study of how to live and how to live well. Within a theistic viewpoint, ethics can be seen as trying to live out our lives as God has intended us to live or would intend us to live. Of course, our own sin gets in the way of this. We've learned how this complicates and muddies the waters so to speak when we are trying to make biblical, ethical decisions about things. Really, every decision we make either contributes to or detracts from our human life as God created it.

Revisiting our ability to make choices in terms of our human nature, we need to recognize that thinking, in and of itself, is a reflection of human nature. Other creatures created by God mostly run off instinct. We on the other hand, have the power to reason, and think, and assess before making a decision. We have the ability to think about the short term effects of a decision. We have the ability to think about the long term effects. We have the ability to reason and rationalize the pros and cons of a decision against both the short term and long term outcomes. For example, eating half a pan of freshly cooked, warm brownies has great short term rewards. It tastes good. It smells good. It's fresh. However, the longer term benefits are not great. You consume too many calories, which may lead to weight gain, or maybe you have to double your workout that day to make up for eating so much.

**Question: How do you typically make ethical decisions? What factors into your ethical decision making process? What doesn't?**

So, we have the ability to make assessments prior to making our choices. We are not defined by instincts so to speak (this is not to say we don't have some instincts as humans but by in large we are not driven by those). Socrates said "the unexamined life is not worth living for a human". So making ethical assessments and decisions is a human act. God designed us in such a way that we have the faculty to be able to reason and apply logic to try and determine the best outcomes for situations we may find ourselves in. Throughout our life, we have to make so many different decisions that have long lasting impacts on our lives and those around us. 

- Should we have aging parents come live with us or should we put them in a medical care facility?
- Should we permit our child to train for gymnastics every weekday evening?
- How do we handle when our child is disobedient? How do we handle them when they are persistently not obeying?
- How do we handle a persistent disobedient child?

David Gordon says "it's right to raise such ethical questions, even before you answer them. Ethics is therefore not merely about answering choice-questions correctly; it's also about sking them in the first place and learning to ask the kinds of questions that might yield good answers" (Choose Better: Five Biblical Models for Making Ethical Decisions). 

### The Choice Between Good and Better
I believe Peter has said this same concept over the course of our time studying ethics, but David Gordon states most of the time we are not choosing between good and evil choices. We are most often choosing between an okay or good choice vs a better choice. Personally, right as I was writing out my lesson plan for this part, Saleena, my wife, asked me if I wanted to take Sophia, my daughter, to her dance class or stay home and receive a dinner meal Debbie & John Christie were dropping off. Neither option inherently good or bad. I opted for taking Sophia to dance class. Not because I didn't want to see John or Debbie, but I knew going to dance would give me quiet time to work on my thoughts for class this morning. I also know Debbie was concerned about Saleena's health and not seeing her at church this past Sunday, so I figured she'd want to see Saleena more than me in this instance. 

In his book, David Gordon gives the example of Luke 10:38-42. __ASK SOMEONE TO READ THIS PART__.

Serving others is not wrong, in fact, it's a good thing to do. However, at this particular time, Mary had made the better choice. By listening to Jesus's instruction, she had chosen the good portion as we see in verse 42. One choice was good. Another choice was better. 

Therefore, our ethical decision making is not merely to distinguish good from bad, but more often, it's to distinguish good from better. The person who makes better choices through life typically has a better life than another person who mostly makes less-good choices.

### Background to David Gordon's Five Models

Ok, let's start getting into David Gordon's Five Models for Making Ethical Decisions. David acknowledges that "...different aspects of the Christian tradition have made particular contributions to the entire church's ethical reasoning. Differing traditions "model" the ethical enterprise differently, and the combination of these [five] models yield more fruit than any one" by itself would. The five models he sees in scripture are:

1. imitation
2. law
3. wisdom
4. communion
5. warfare

David says each of the models can be thought as question clusters. Each model asks a different set of questions and each of those set of questions bring their own insight to an ethical perspective/decision making process. He goes on to give an example in the book between the law and wisdom models. The law model is primarily concerned whether or not an action is prescribed or proscribed by God in the Bible - what behaviors are required or what is forbidden. Whereas, the wisdom model asks what kinds of effects and consequences will our decisions have. For example, many proverbs commend and action but don't command an action. However, if we are talking about biblical law, say in Leviticus, those laws are commanding. The wisdom model asks us to think of the possible outcomes our choices could have. What effects could these choices have and how would those ripple out to others. This model's approach is more contemplative than the law model. However, the law model recognizes that there are moments in life where we may not have the time to contemplate and action, and we must act immediately. 

Each of the five models can be thought as its own tool. I'm in the process of finishing my basement at my house. As I've working on framing, putting up insulation, installing electrical wire and outlet boxes, I've needed different tools. My air nailer works great when I'm framing walls on the ground; however, it doesn't help me one bit when I need to drill a hole through the wall studs to run electrical wiring. The models, like the tools I've been using in my basement, are used and working towards the same goal. Each of the models he derived from scripture are necessary, yet insufficient in and of themselves, to inform every ethical quandry that comes our way. Knowing how each of these models work will equip us to be able to make better ethical choices in life.

### Introduction to the Five Models

#### The Imitation Model
"The imitation model understands human life to consist, ideally, in our being like God on a creaturely scale". Humans were created in the image of God and thus must reflect many praiseworthy attributes of God. This model emphasizes what one __is__ vs what one __does__. Functionally, this model requires to learn about God and what is great and praiseworthy about him, especially as revealed through Jesus. 

"The imitation model asks and answers the following question: does this decision allow me (or us) to emulate God or to cultivate human traits that reflect his image?".

#### The Law Model
"The law model understands human life to consist, ideally, in our obeying God, who has rightful authority to order his creation as he wishes. God sustains the relation of the Lawgiver and Judge to his creation, and the creature must acknowledge this relation by obeying God's commands and wishes."

The law model asks and answers the following question: has God, in Holy Scripture, commanded or prohibited this behavior?

#### The Wisdom Model
"The wisdom model understands life to consist, ideally, in making wise choices moment by moment, day by day. The human is understood to have the ability to observe and learn from observing, that there are choices that contribute to or detract from order, health, and faith."

The wisdom model answers the following question: what is the likely outcome of my/our doing or not doing this?

#### The Communion Model
The communion model understands human life to consist in communication with God. The human is understood to have the unique ability, among creatures, of linguistic communicaton. We are able to address and be addressed by God. With this model, prayer is not something we do occassionally, in moments or seasons of special need. Life itself is prayer. A fellowship with God.

The communion model answers the following question: how might this option enhance or hinder my communion with God?

#### The warfare model
The final model is the warfare model. This model understands like as a war, in which we are enlisted soldiers for one side. Our duties are then thought of as both defensive and offensive, both resisting and attacking the enemy ourselves and gaining new ground. 

The warfare model helps answer the following question: In the often invisible, yet real warfare between the forces of good and evil, will this decision likely serve the forces of good or the forces of evil.


**Question - Based on the initial descriptions, which model do you tend to draw on most often when evaluating ethical questions or dilemmas?**

**Question (if time allows) - Complete the following sentences: My family of origin emphazied the __________ model when I was growing up. My family of origin neglected the _______ model. Give examples**
