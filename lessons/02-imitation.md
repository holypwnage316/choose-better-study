## Recap from Last Lesson `slide 3`
Good morning. If you missed last week, we have started into a series of lessons from David Gordon's *Choose Better* book, in which he presents 5 models for helping to make biblical ethical decisions or choices in scripture. Those models are:
    1. imitation
    2. law
    3. wisdom
    4. communion
    5. warfare

Today, we will focus on taking a deep dive into the first model, the Imitation Model.

## Overview `slide 4`
The Imitation Model calls us to follow the example of Christ and other godly individuals in Scripture. 

We look at how Jesus lived, how Paul conducted his ministry, and how the heroes of faith responded to challenges.

If you recall, this model asks us to ponder this question: **does this decision allow us to emulate God or to cultivate human traits that reflect his image?**

David argues that this model has been a foundational model throughout the church's history. He goes on to quote a few church leaders throughout the ages. Here are some examples: `slide 5`
 - Why art thou proud, o man? God for thee became low. Thou wouldst perhaps be ashamed to imitate a lowly man; then at least imitate the lowly God. (Augustine, _Confessions_)
 - Christ is our pattern, whom we must strive to imitate. It is necessary that our pattern should be exact, that so we might see our imperfections, and be humbled for them, and live by faith in our sanctification. (Richard Sibbes, _Divine Meditations_)
 - Ok here's the final one, as Charles Sheldon said in his book, _In His Steps_, what would Jesus do?

 From the earliest days of the Christian church to the present... from the most sophisticated Christian theologian to the simplest disciple... the imitation model has captivated those who have reflected upon it. Entire generations of the church have spoken the language of the imitation model to express what it means to live as a Christian. `slide 6`

**Discussion Question:** How does a secular understanding of ethics prohibit the use of the imitation model? In what ways does the secular world still "borrow capital," so to speak, from the imitation model? `slide 7`

 ## The Biblical Basis for the Imitation Model `slide 8`

David says the imitation model arises naturally from the twin realities that:
 1) humans alone were created in the image of God and 
 2) we are commanded to be like God. 
 
 Let's consider this scripture passage: `slide 9`

> Then God said, "Let us make man in _our image_, after _our likeness_. And let them have dominion over the fish of the sea and over the birds of the heavens and over the livestock and over all the earth and over every creeping thing that creeps on the earth". So God created man _in his own image, in the image of God_ he created him; male and female he created them. (Genesis 1:26-7)

 Four times in these two verses recording God's decree to create humankind, God states that humans are to be made like him. And it's not just Genesis — throughout Scripture, humans are frequently commanded to do or to be things that are like God. Let's read some of those examples through scripture. 
**ASK FOR VOLUNTEERS TO READ THE FOLLOWING** `slide 10`
 - Lev. 19:2
 - John 13:34
 - Romans 8:29
 - Ephesians 5:1
 - 1 John 3:2

 We see we are called to be like God and imitate him. But if we are to imitate God, we need to know him — which raises an important question.

**Discussion Question:** Why do we need an intimate and growing knowledge of, and relationship with, God to employ the imitation model? How can you foster this knowledge of God in your life? `slide 11`

 ## The Imitation Model and Human Nature `slide 12`
 So we've established the biblical call to imitate God. But how does that actually work? It turns out, humans learn by imitation; it's one of the most fundamental aspects of our created nature. Consider this example, why does an American child typically speak English? Why does a young French child speak French? Had either of them studied both languages and chosen one over the other? Of course not. Each is speaking the language spoken in their home.

 We make hundreds, or maybe thousands, of other behavioral choices simply by imitating what we observe around us. One aspect of this capacity to learn by example is the ability to discern what is praiseworthy, excellent, or noble and to imitate it. Consider the Winter Olympics going on right now, we are drawn to watching an athlete compete and break a world record or be the top in their field amongst global competitors. 

 Our innate capacity to learn by imitation was a blessing to the human race before the fall. `slide 13` We were only imitating God himself and innocent humans. But after the fall, we either imitate virtue or vice. John the apostle warns us "Beloved, do not imitate evil but imitate good. Whoever does good is from God; whoever does evil has not seen God" (3 John 1:11). John recognized our capacity to imitate can either be employed for good or evil, however the capacity is there nonetheless.

 The capacity to imitate was one of the great gifts God gave us humans. `slide 14` An aspect of our being is being made in the imago Dei (in the image of God). Implicit in our being made in God's image is being uniquely endowed with the capacity to behave like God on a creaturely scale. It is David's opinion that if we had remained innocent in the garden, we would not have needed the other models, such as the law model. Imitation alone would have been sufficient for the rest of our lives.

**Discussion Question:** How does our fallen nature affect our ability to employ the imitation model? List several challenges that our fallenness presents to the exercise of this model. `slide 15`

 ## Imitating God's Traits and Deeds `slide 16`
 The imitation model provides more specific guidance for human existence by teaching us to imitate God's traits and his deeds, his attributes and his works. Some of God's traits or attributes cannot be imitated - we call these the incommunicable attributes of God. Some examples:
    - God is immutable; we are not
    - God is eternal; we are not
    - God is infinite; we are not

In the same manner, we can't always precisely imitate some of God's acts and deeds. God created out of nothing; we create out of what already exists and we fashion it for a new purpose. For example, turning a rock into an arrowhead. Creating wood building materials out of trees. 

God alone can redeem and only God can atone for human sin in the work of Jesus Christ. `slide 17` We simply cannot imitate his work here. However, even amongst these incommunicable acts, there is something we can imitate. A novelist can, in his/her imagination, "create" a previously nonexistent world, fill it with animals that talk or wizards who can cast spells - for instance ponder the grandeur of the worlds CS Lewis put together in Narnia, or JRR Tolkien in Middle Earth, or JK Rowling in Harry Potter.

Similarly, we cannot atone for one another's sins, but we can speak truthful and loving words that direct others to the Christian gospel. We can also, by discretion and wisdom, "cover" the imperfections of others by keeping them private (which is covered by the 9th commandment, see Westminster Larger Catechism Q&A 143-145).

As a guide to human behavior, the imitation model provokes a disciplined, sustained, and careful discussion of God's attributes and God's works in order to gain a vision for what we are called to imitate. Broadly speaking, God's works are of making, sustaining, and redeeming. `slide 18` So, humans who are creative, or who are good stewards of the resources under their supervision, are imitating God. Similarly, humans who are redemptive in a broad sense, those who attempt to heal wounds, help fix injuries, or reconcile strife, are imitating a redemptive maker.

Thus as an ethical model, the imitation model encourages considering, for each ethical decision making moment, whether the choices before us allow us to imitate God by making, sustaining, or redeeming. Let's unpack God's works a bit further.

 ## God's Deeds are Four `slide 19`
 God has surely done more than four things, but David Gordon argues all that he has done falls into one of four categories:
    - God creates
    - God judges what he created
    - God providentially sustains
    - God redeems

Therefore as imitators of God's deeds, we ask ourselves at each moment: is there an opportunity here to be like our making, judging, preserving, and repairing God? Is there an opportunity to be creative? Is there an opportunity to evaluate or judge some created thing, noticing how it was made? Is there an opportunity to be prudent in maintaining something that already exists? Is there an opportunity to repair something that is broken, whether that be a child's toy or a relationship between two friends?

What is true of God's deeds is also true of his attributes. The imitation model encourages us to understand why they are praiseworthy and how we can imitate them. David Gordon encourages us to ask to consider the following questions about each of God's traits: `slide 20`
1. What is the trait(ex love, wisdom, power, holiness, justice, benevolence, faithfulness, truthfulness, mercy, patience, kindness, gentleness, wrath, jealousy)?
2. What Scriptures teach that God has this trait?
3. Why is this trait praiseworthy?
4. Why is it important to us, as creatures, that God has this trait?
5. Why is it important to us, as fallen creatures, that God has this trait?
6. What can we do, with the aid of the Holy Spirit, to cultivate this trait ourselves?
7. What attitudes, affections, or behaviors prohibit the cultivation of this trait?

By raising these questions, we reflect the virtue that is revealed in God's character and actions. We are drawn into both an understanding and admiration of the trait, which leads us to emulate it.

Let's work through an example of how the imitation model works through these questions. Let's walk through justice. `slide 21`

1. What is justice? 
 - The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language says "the attainment of what is just, especially that which is fair, moral, right, merited, or in accordance with law"
 - Christian theologians have often identified several dimensions of this trait
    - such perfection of moral character that abhors wickedness and loves uprightness
    - the notion of equity or impartiality - that people are treated without regard for their persons but with regard for what they have actually done

2. What scriptures teach that God has this trait? `slide 22`
 - Many scripture passages teach on God's justice trait. A few examples:
    - On his perfection of moral character - Psalm 11:7 __For the Lord is righteous; he loves righteous deeds; the upright shall behold his face__
    - Equity or impartiality - 1 Peter 1:17 - __If you call on him as Father who judges impartially according to each one's deeds, conduct yourselves with fear throughout the time of your exile__

3. Why is this trait praiseworthy? `slide 23`
David Gordon states that for many, this trait is not immediately attractive. God's justice is something we as sinners may understandably fear. We often avoid or try to hide from God's judgement just like our first parents did. If not for the principle of substitution, we could not, as sinners, heartily praise God's justice. However, we like to see justice given out on those who have wronged us. 

God's justice is perhaps best appreciated when we witness its absence. When we are judged unjustly by a human judge - whether civil, ecclesiastical, or domestic - we appreciate justice by abhorring injustice. When the wicked are not held accountable for their crimes, we instinctively sense that a great wrong has been done. When judges are bribed, we instinctively recoil.

4. Why is it important to us, as creatures, that God has this trait? `slide 24`
God assures us that he is not blind to the injustice in the world that we see. The wicked may get away with things in this life but not forever. At the return of Christ, there will be an accounting for every thought, word, and deed, every angry Facebook or X post, and the unjust will receive from the hand of God the punishment that their wickedness deserves.

5. Why is it important to us, as fallen creatures, that God has this trait?
As fallen creatures, we may initially fear God's justice; however, as we consider the work of Christ, how perfect his obedience was, we start to understand how fully he satisfied divine justice.

6. What can we do, with the aid of the Holy Spirit, to cultivate this trait ourselves? `slide 25`
We can ask ourselves whether we are being unjust or just in offices of power we hold. Husbands are you just or unjust in leading your wife. Parents are you shepherding your kids justly? Do you supervise people at work? Teachers and professors ought to grade students impartially.

7. What attitudes, affections, or behaviors prohibit the cultivation of this trait? `slide 26`
- _false sympathy_ - Sympathy is appropriate when people have experienced pain or heartache. David says it is not appropriate when we are evaluating whether or not someone has done right or wrong. 
- _fearing men more than God_ - When we are more concerned about pleasing people rather than God, we are inherently perverting justice by basing our decision on whether or not the people will like what we've done or not.
- _partiality_ - We cannot permit our judgements to be influenced by personal considerations. We must evaluate when called to do so, with consistent, impartial standards. 
 - A personal anecdotal example I can give here is my recent experience interviewing candidates for a principal software engineering position at my workplace. I've interviewed about 6-7 different people. My company doesn't have a set of questions to ask the candidates or anything like that. However, I have used the same set of Golang programming and Kubernetes based questions on each of the candidates so that I can evaluate each candidate based on the same scale.

So that's how the imitation model works in practice when we apply it to a specific trait like justice. Now, as powerful as this model is, it does come with some challenges.

 ## Special Challenges to the Imitation Model `slide 27`

For one, the imitation model is not fast compared to the law model. For one, it is not fast compared to the law model. The imitation model requires a substantial amount of studying. We need to know and understand God's traits and works before we can begin to try and imitate them.

Another challenge is not all of God's traits can be imitated by a mere creature as we discussed previously. Theologians distinguish the communicable attributes from the incommunicable attributes. The incommunicable attributes such as eternity, omniscience, and omnipotence, are attributes that God alone has and he does not share with his creatures.

These limitations are part of why David Gordon presents five models rather than just one. The imitation model is foundational, but it doesn't stand alone.

**Discussion Question:** How might the imitation model fall short if we use it in isolation from the other four models? `slide 28`

**Discussion Question (if time allows):** Consider a situation in your own life where the imitation model could help you work through ethical questions. Describe the situation and discuss how the imitation model provides valuable discernment. `slide 29`

## Key Takeaways `slide 30`

- Christ is our ultimate example
- Scripture provides many models of faithful living
- Imitation requires understanding context, not just copying actions
