# The Communion Model

[Back to Home](../)

## Key Question

*What choice will draw me closer to God and strengthen the body of Christ?*

## Overview

The Communion Model focuses on making decisions that maintain and deepen our fellowship with God and with other believers. Some choices, while not explicitly sinful, can hinder our walk with God or harm our relationships within the church.

## Discussion Questions

1. How might a "permissible" choice still harm your communion with God?
2. How do our individual choices affect the body of Christ?
3. What does it mean to consider others' consciences in our decisions?

## Key Takeaways

- Relationship with God is the ultimate goal
- Our choices affect the whole body
- Love for others shapes our freedom
