                <p>David Gordon's <em>Choose Better</em> presents <strong>5 models</strong> for biblical ethical decision-making:</p>
                <br>
                <ol>
                    <li>Imitation</li>

                <br>

            <!-- Slide 4: Overview -->
            <section>
                <h2>Overview</h2>
                <p>The Imitation Model calls us to follow the example of Christ and other godly individuals in Scripture.</p>
                <br>
                <p>We look at how Jesus lived, how Paul conducted his ministry, and how the heroes of faith responded to challenges.</p>
                <br>
                <p class="highlight" style="font-size: 1.1em;">
                    Does this decision allow us to emulate God or to cultivate human traits that reflect his image?

                    "From the earliest days of the Christian church to the present... from the most sophisticated Christian theologian to the simplest disciple... the imitation model has captivated those who have reflected upon it."
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>Entire generations of the church have spoken the language of the imitation model to express what it means to live as a Christian.</p>

                    <h2>Discussion Question</h2>
                    <p>How does a secular understanding of ethics prohibit the use of the imitation model?</p>
                    <p style="margin-top: 20px; font-size: 0.9em;">
                        In what ways does the secular world still "borrow capital," so to speak, from the imitation model?

            </section>

            <!-- Slide 8: Biblical Basis -->
            <section>
                <h2>The Biblical Basis</h2>
                <p>The imitation model arises naturally from twin realities:</p>
                <br>
                <div class="model-card">
                    <p><strong>1)</strong> Humans alone were created in the <span class="highlight">image of God</span></p>
                </div>
                <div class="model-card">
                    <p><strong>2)</strong> We are <span class="highlight">commanded to be like God</span></p>
                </div>
            </section>

            <!-- Slide 9: Genesis 1:26-27 -->
            <section>
                <h2>Created in His Image</h2>
                <div class="scripture-box">
                    <span class="scripture-ref">Genesis 1:26-27</span>
                    <p>Then God said, "Let us make man in <strong>our image</strong>, after <strong>our likeness</strong>. And let them have dominion over the fish of the sea and over the birds of the heavens and over the livestock and over all the earth and over every creeping thing that creeps on the earth."</p>
                    <p style="margin-top: 15px;">So God created man <strong>in his own image</strong>, <strong>in the image of God</strong> he created him; male and female he created them.</p>
                </div>
                <p style="margin-top: 15px; font-size: 0.85em;"><em>Four times</em> in two verses, God states that humans are to be made like him.</p>
            </section>

            <!-- Slide 10: Scripture Reading -->
            <section>
                <h2>Commanded to Be Like God</h2>
                <p>Let's read some examples through Scripture:</p>
                <br>
                <ul>
                    <li>Leviticus 19:2</li>
                    <li>John 13:34</li>
                    <li>Romans 8:29</li>
                    <li>Ephesians 5:1</li>
                    <li>1 John 3:2</li>
                </ul>
                <br>
                <p style="font-style: italic; color: #7f8c8d;">We are called to be like God and imitate him.</p>

                    <h2>Discussion Question</h2>
                    <p>Why do we need an intimate and growing knowledge of, and relationship with, God to employ the imitation model?</p>

            <section>
                <h2>The Imitation Model &amp; Human Nature</h2>
                <p>Humans learn by imitation — it's one of the most fundamental aspects of our created nature.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Why does an American child speak English? Why does a French child speak French?</p>
                <br>
                <p>We make hundreds, maybe thousands, of behavioral choices simply by <span class="highlight">imitating what we observe</span> around us.</p>
            </section>

            <!-- Slide 13: Before and After the Fall -->
            <section>
                <h2>Virtue or Vice</h2>
                <p>Before the fall, our capacity for imitation was purely a blessing — we were only imitating God himself and innocent humans.</p>
                <br>
                <p>But after the fall, we either imitate <span class="highlight">virtue</span> or <span class="highlight">vice</span>.</p>
                <br>
                <div class="scripture-box">

            <!-- Slide 14: Imago Dei -->
            <section>
                <h2>Imago Dei</h2>
                <p>The capacity to imitate was one of the great gifts God gave us.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Implicit in our being made in God's image is being uniquely endowed with the capacity to <span class="highlight">behave like God on a creaturely scale</span>.</p>
                <br>
                <p style="font-style: italic; font-size: 0.9em; color: #7f8c8d;">
                    Had we remained innocent in the garden, imitation alone would have been sufficient for the rest of our lives.

            <section>
                <h2>Imitating God's Traits &amp; Deeds</h2>
                <p>The imitation model teaches us to imitate God's <strong>traits</strong> (attributes) and his <strong>deeds</strong> (works).</p>
                <br>
                <p>Some of God's attributes <em>cannot</em> be imitated — the <span class="highlight">incommunicable attributes</span>:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>God is immutable; we are not</li>
                    <li>God is eternal; we are not</li>
                    <li>God is infinite; we are not</li>

            <section>
                <h2>What We <em>Can</em> Imitate</h2>
                <p>Even amongst incommunicable acts, there is something we can imitate.</p>
                <br>
                <p>God created out of nothing — we create out of what already exists and fashion it for a new purpose.</p>
                <br>
                <p>We cannot atone for one another's sins, but we can speak truthful and loving words that direct others to the Christian gospel.</p>
                <br>
                <p style="font-size: 0.85em; color: #7f8c8d;">We can also "cover" the imperfections of others by keeping them private (9th commandment; WLC Q&amp;A 143-145).</p>

                <p>All that God has done falls into one of four categories:</p>
                <br>
                <ol class="four-deeds-list">
                    <li>God creates</li>

                <p style="font-size: 0.85em; font-style: italic;">
                    At each moment we ask: is there an opportunity to be like our making, judging, preserving, and repairing God?

            <!-- Slide 21: Justice Example - Title -->
            <section>
                <h2>Worked Example: Justice</h2>
                <p>Let's walk through the seven questions using <span class="highlight">justice</span> as our example.</p>
                <br>
                <div class="model-card">
                    <h3>What is justice?</h3>
                    <p>"The attainment of what is just, especially that which is fair, moral, right, merited, or in accordance with law"</p>
                </div>
                <br>
                <ul style="font-size: 0.85em;">
                    <li>Perfection of moral character that abhors wickedness and loves uprightness</li>
                    <li>Equity or impartiality — people treated with regard for what they have actually done</li>
                </ul>
            </section>

            <!-- Slide 22: Justice - Scriptures -->
            <section>
                <h2>Justice in Scripture</h2>
                <div class="scripture-box">
                    <span class="scripture-ref">Psalm 11:7</span>
                    <p>"For the Lord is righteous; he loves righteous deeds; the upright shall behold his face."</p>
                </div>
                <div class="scripture-box">
                    <span class="scripture-ref">1 Peter 1:17</span>
                    <p>"If you call on him as Father who judges impartially according to each one's deeds, conduct yourselves with fear throughout the time of your exile."</p>
                </div>
            </section>

            <!-- Slide 23: Justice - Praiseworthy -->
            <section>
                <h2>Why Is Justice Praiseworthy?</h2>
                <p>For many, this trait is not immediately attractive — as sinners, we may fear God's justice.</p>
                <br>
                <p>God's justice is perhaps best appreciated when we witness <span class="highlight">its absence</span>.</p>
                <br>
                <ul style="font-size: 0.9em;">
                    <li>When we are judged unjustly — whether civil, ecclesiastical, or domestic</li>
                    <li>When the wicked are not held accountable</li>
                    <li>When judges are bribed</li>
                </ul>
                <br>
                <p style="font-style: italic; font-size: 0.85em;">We instinctively recoil — we appreciate justice by abhorring injustice.</p>

            <section>
                <h2>Why Does God's Justice Matter?</h2>
                <div class="model-card">
                    <h3>As creatures</h3>
                    <p>God assures us he is not blind to injustice. The wicked may get away with things in this life but not forever. At the return of Christ, there will be an accounting for every thought, word, and deed.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="model-card">
                    <h3>As fallen creatures</h3>
                    <p>We may initially fear God's justice; however, as we consider Christ's perfect obedience, we understand how fully he satisfied divine justice.</p>

            <!-- Slide 25: Justice - Cultivating -->
            <section>
                <h2>Cultivating Justice</h2>
                <p>We can ask ourselves whether we are being just in the offices of power we hold:</p>
                <br>
                <ul>
                    <li>Husbands — are you just in leading your wife?</li>
                    <li>Parents — are you shepherding your kids justly?</li>
                    <li>Supervisors — are you fair with those under you?</li>
                    <li>Teachers — do you grade impartially?</li>

                <h2>What Prohibits Justice?</h2>
                <div class="model-card">
                    <h3>False Sympathy</h3>
                    <p>Sympathy is appropriate for pain and heartache, but not when evaluating whether someone has done right or wrong.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="model-card">
                    <h3>Fearing Men More Than God</h3>
                    <p>When we are more concerned about pleasing people than God, we pervert justice.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="model-card">
                    <h3>Partiality</h3>
                    <p>We cannot permit our judgements to be influenced by personal considerations. We must evaluate with consistent, impartial standards.</p>
                </div>

            <!-- Slide 27: Special Challenges -->
            <section>
                <h2>Special Challenges</h2>
                <p>The imitation model comes with challenges:</p>
                <br>
                <div class="model-card">
                    <h3>It requires deep study</h3>
                    <p>Compared to the law model, the imitation model is not fast. We need to know and understand God's traits and works before we can imitate them.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="model-card">
                    <h3>Not all traits can be imitated</h3>
                    <p>The incommunicable attributes — eternity, omniscience, omnipotence — are attributes God alone has and does not share with his creatures.</p>
                </div>
                <br>
                <p style="font-style: italic; font-size: 0.85em;">These limitations are why David Gordon presents five models rather than just one.</p>
