## Recap from last time
Good morning. If you missed the past couple of weeks, we have started into a series of lessons from David Gordon's *Choose Better* book, in which he presents 5 models for helping to make biblical ethical decisions or choices in scripture. 

Last week, we discussed the imitation model. This week, we will take a deep dive into the law model. 

## Overview
The Law Model focuses on obeying God's commands as revealed in Scripture, particularly the moral law summarized in the Ten Commandments. Some ethical decisions are straightforward: God has spoken clearly, and our job is to obey.

More succinctly, the model answers this question: Has God, in Holy Scripture, commanded or prohibited this behavior?

God has the rightful authority to direct that which he has made. This model of ethics acknowledges he has the 1) right to govern us and 2) he has the perfect wisdom and love by which to govern us. Consider Psalm 100:3 :
> Know that the Lord, he is God! It is he who made us, and we are his; we are his people, and the sheep of his pasture.

and here in 1st Corinthians 6:20:
> You were bought with a price. So glorify God in your body.

We were _created_ by God, providentially _sustained_ by him, and we are _redeemed_ by him, so thrice obligated to serve him.

God's creating us not only grants him the authority to rule us, but it also ensures that he _knows_ us well and is therefore _qualified_, by love and wisdom, to rule for our benefit.

> **Discussion:** How does the secular world "borrow capital" from the biblical understanding of the law model?

With that foundation in mind, let's look at some of the biblical bases for this ethical decision-making model.

## Biblical Basis for the Law Model
The law model is derived from the persistence of divinely revealed commands in the Bible. 

Let's look at the example in Genesis - God not only creates, but in the very act, issues a decree for how each aspect of what he has created is to serve him. David Gordon argues that God effectively commanded each aspect of the created order to serve him by fulfilling a particular task, including the human's task to "have dominion over the fish of the sea and over the birds of the heavens and over the livestock and over all the earth and over every creeping thing that creeps on the earth". All human suffering results from Adam's disobedience of God's prohibition against eating the fruit of one particular tree.

Here's another example from Moses' time - the covenant administration inaugurated at Mount Sinai through Moses is characterized by laws; at the institution of the covenant itself, Moses brings down "ten words" from the mountain, at least nine of them are commands.

Finally - after Christ's resurrection and he's about to ascend to heaven, he instructs his apostles to teach others "to observe all that I have commanded you".

So from Genesis to the Great Commission, God's commands are woven throughout the whole story of Scripture. But how has the church historically understood and applied this model? And why is it so important for us as fallen people?

## The Law Model and Human Nature
The law model has played a dominant role in the church's discussion of ethics, especially since the Protestant Reformation. Luther's Small Catechism, the Heidelberg Catechism, and both the Shorter and Larger Catechisms of the Westminster Assembly all contain an exposition of the decalogue.

The Protestant tradition has found it helpful to summarize Christian duty by employing the ten words given at Sinai, although the law model itself does not restrict itself to ten words. Indeed, the law model could function just as well by employing the two great commands, the new commandment, or some other summary of the law. The particular structure of the law model itself is less significant than the fact that it recognizes God's rightful _authority_ to rule us, as well as his wisdom and love that make his rule a _blessing_ to us.

The benefits of the law model are substantial. It promotes an appropriate amount of humility as we recognize that we exist under the authority of our Maker. The model also provides a rich, specific directives for many human questions - you should not murder, you should not commit adultery, you shall not steal, you shall not covet. What David Gordon is saying here is the human race is not left alone to discover every ethical answer by trial and error. God, as the governor of the human race, has given us specific commands that help direct us in healthy paths and protect us from unhealthy paths.

The law model is necessary for us in our fallen condition because our affections and desires have been tainted by sin. Like a child who reaches up to touch a hot stove, we often exhibit an unhealthy curiosity to explore dangerous areas. Many of God's laws are framed in a negative manner; those framed this way prohibit behaviors that are most likely to hurt us or others or degrade God's image within us. The apostle Paul was all too aware that sinners like us need laws as he always locates "law" in a post fallen world. Take these two passages as consideration:
 - Sin indeed was in the world before the law was given (Romans 5:13)
 - Why then the law? It was added because of transgressions (Galatians 3:19)

 Indeed, Paul goes further in 1 Timothy (HAVE SOMEONE READ 1 Tim 1:8-10). Some commentators think that Paul is being hyperbolic here, maybe because of some special reason at Ephesus, but David Gordon argues we have every reason to take his statement at face value. 

 However, we may speculate regarding the utility of the law even for the innocent, biblical commands are certainly a special and necessary aid for us in our yet fallen condition. They are a kind gift from God for us whose moral nature is fallen, just as a parent's warning to their child about not touching a hot stove.

> **Discussion:** Rightly understood, the law model should foster humility rather than pride and legalism. Why?

## How the Law Model Functions
The law model functions in a fairly straightforward way. As we consider any behavioral choice, the model asks us whether God commands or prohibits the behavior in question. If we find ourselves asking is it okay to desire another person's possessions, we find that God's law prohibits covetousness. If we find ourselves in a malicious rage, desiring to injure someone, we find his law prohibits murder and malicious thoughts. If we ask what our duty is to our parents, we find that God commands us to honor them.

This directness and clarity is what perhaps makes the law model such an efficient model for ethics and may explain why the law model has predominated conversations in so many circles.

> **Discussion:** How does interaction with the other models prevent the law model from becoming a tool for promoting legalism?

As powerful as the law model is, it's not without some special challenges. Let's chat about those now.

## Special Challenges to the Law Model
The special challenges inherent in the law model are due to the fact that, while the equivalent of an imperative mood in Hebrew or Greek is fairly easy to discern, some commands recorded in Scripture do not oblige everyone. We must learn to discern commands that oblige us from commands that do not oblige us. David Gordon says we must specifically distinguish these three things:
- local or particular laws from general or universal laws
- temporary laws from eternal laws
- specific covenant stipulations from moral principles

Each of these is a unique challenge, so we must briefly discuss how to make such distinctions. Let's cover the first one - local or particular laws from general or universal laws.

### Local or Particular Laws vs General or Universal Laws
Some commands in Scripture are addressed to specific individuals or groups. As such, they do not oblige us to the duty contained within them. They only oblige us to belive that God gave that duty to particular individuals or groups. Here's an example from Timothy:

> when you come, bring the cloak that I left with Carpus at Troas, also the books, and above all the parchments" (2 Timothy 4:13)

Evidently, this command only applies to Timothy. Common sense helps prevent anyone from misapplying the command as a universal imperative. However several verses earlier, Paul says this:

>  as for you, always be sober-minded, endure suffering, _do the work of an evangelist_, fulfill your ministry (4:5)

The italicized portion is regularly understood to be a general/universal command, while the "fulfill your ministry" suggests that the command is specific to Timothy.

While there are no silver bullet methods to resolve every questioned application of a local or particular command, David Gordon argues there are strategies that help us in most circumstances. He recommends asking a simple twofold question: To whom was the command originally given? Is my relation to God (or someone else issuing the command such as Paul) the same as that of the individual or group to whom the command was given?

Let's move on to the next special challenge with this model - distinguishing temporary laws from eternal laws.

### Temporary Laws vs Eternal Laws
Some laws in scripture are temporary obligations rather than obligations for all people for all time. For example many of the Mosaic laws obliged the old covenant Israelites but they do not oblige new covenant believers (examples - circumcision, ceremonial laws, civil laws). What makes this difficult is that some of these laws _did_ oblige God's visible covenant people for hundreds of years. It was very hard for the first generation of the Christian covenant to abandon them.

The Jerusalem Council recorded in Acts 15 candidly reveals the apostles themselves did not have an immediate answer to the problem. Paul's problems with the Galatians and Peter reveal the problem did not resolve itself easily.

What makes some of these commands especially difficult is the fact that they are often described, in English translations at least, as being eternal or forever or everlasting. Take the Feast of the Firstfruits from Leviticus 23:14 for example, it called this "a statute forever throughout your generations" even though the Jewish calendar expired with the resurrection of Christ. The language sounds like it's an everlasting command even though subsequent teaching of the New Testament makes it clear they are not.

The task of distinguishing temporary from everlasting commands is not as simple as one might think. We must be willing to distinguish commands that delineate the relation between creatures and their Creator from those that merely lasted for the duration of a given covenant administration.

> **Discussion:** Can you think of an Old Testament command that was described as "eternal" or "forever" but no longer applies to new covenant believers? How do you know it no longer applies?

That leads us into our last special challenge, which is closely related - distinguishing specific covenant stipulations from general moral principles.

### Specific Covenant Stipulations vs General Moral Principles
In a technical sense, the Bible does not contain universal laws as we, influenced by Greek philosphy, understand them. All of the biblical laws are in fact covenant stipulations, and they are placed by God on the party or parties with whom he covenants. Although some of these stipulations bear a moral obligation that extends beyond the particular covenant in which they were first recorded, as originally given, they oblige only those to whom God gave them.

A quick example of this is just as I am not obligated to make mortgage payments to your banker, nor you to my banker, we are contracted only to our own respective bankers, so also the commands in the Bible always appear in a given covenantal context - they are addressed to, and therefore oblige only, a specific covenant people.

Since the various commands of the Bible are always delivered in a given covenantal context, how do we determine that some of the commands oblige others also? David Gordon argues these seven guidelines may help:
1. Is a given law (or body of laws) reiterated in another covenant administration?
2. Is a given law (or body of laws) reiterated in the covenant in which we find ourselves?
3. Is a given law (or body of laws) supplied prior to the fall?
4. Does a command describe the final, redeemed state?
5. Is a given law supplied with a rationale that is extra-covenantal?
6. Does a given command reflect a moral attribute of God, whom we were created to imitate?
7. Does the content of a given command reflect the distinctive features of a given covenant administration?

> **Discussion:** What does it mean to see "covenantal integrity" between the stipulations of the Sinai covenant and those of the new covenant?

## Summary
Every biblical law is governed by two things: the Creator's innate, morally praiseworthy, and unchanging moral character, and the Creator's purposes for particular creatures. 

Every law given by God is thus consistent with both his unvarying moral being and his varying purposes for various creatures. His laws for humans for example are quite different than those for other creatures created by him. 

Similarly, some of God's purposes for covenant Israel were different from his purposes for the patriarchs and his purposes for the new covenant community. It was _consistent_ with God's moral character to command David and Solomon to erect a temple as a place to offer sacrifices; it was equally _consistent_ with his moral character to do away with this temple in the new covenant administration (see 1 Cor. 3:16-17). Again, the law _requiring_ circumcision, and the apostolic mandate _refusing_ its requirement, are both consistent with God's moral character, but they are not equally consistent with his purposes for his various covenant communities.

> **Discussion:** Consider a situation in your own life where the law model could help you work through a specific ethical question. Describe the situation and explain how the law model provides values discernment.

## Key Takeaways

- God's commands provide clear ethical guidance
- The moral law reflects God's character
- Obedience flows from gratitude, not legalism
