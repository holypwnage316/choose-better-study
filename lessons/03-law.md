# The Law Model

[Back to Home](../)

## Key Question

*What has God commanded? What does the law require?*

## Overview

The Law Model focuses on obeying God's commands as revealed in Scripture, particularly the moral law summarized in the Ten Commandments. Some ethical decisions are straightforward: God has spoken clearly, and our job is to obey.

## Discussion Questions

1. When is the Law Model most clearly applicable?
2. How do we distinguish between ceremonial laws (fulfilled in Christ) and moral laws (still binding)?
3. How does grace relate to law-keeping in the Christian life?

## Key Takeaways

- God's commands provide clear ethical guidance
- The moral law reflects God's character
- Obedience flows from gratitude, not legalism
