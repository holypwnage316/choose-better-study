# Choose Better: Five Biblical Models for Making Ethical Decisions

A Sunday school study based on the book by T. David Gordon.

## About the Book

*Choose Better: Five Biblical Models for Making Ethical Decisions* presents a comprehensive approach to Christian ethics by examining five distinct biblical models for moral decision-making. Rather than advocating for a single method, Gordon argues that Scripture itself employs multiple ethical frameworks, and mature believers should learn to use all five appropriately depending on the situation.
